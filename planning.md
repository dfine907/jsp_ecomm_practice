PLANNING NOTES


STEP 1:

 1.Use the data from the fake store API:
 https://fakestoreapi.com/products

 - Create a file to store the array data of products and attach to index.html


2. Match the design below or feel free to display the data in another way. At minimum display:
-Title
-Price
-Image
-Button that reads “Buy”


- Create card div that will be a place to hold the information for each product as well as a button.
 --Use an html element to add each of the items
 --Use a loop 
    The loop needs to access each data item wanted and render ontp the page.
    A button for each item must also be created.

STEP 2

1. Add a “Total” at the top of the page
- Create a h3 div? that will contain all the added prices.
    Use reduce method to access each price in the area.

2. Every time a user clicks on the “Buy” button, the total should be incremented
- loop through each item and add each price +=


-- Create a function for a callback for the buy button.
The call back will take the selected price, store in an array and add all the items.
