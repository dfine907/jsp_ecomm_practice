PLANNING NOTES


STEP 1:

 1.Use the data from the fake store API:
 https://fakestoreapi.com/products

 - Create a file to store the array data of products and attach to index.html


2. Match the design below or feel free to display the data in another way. At minimum display:
-Title
-Price
-Image
-Button that reads “Buy”


- Create card div that will be a place to hold the information for each product as well as a button.
 --Use an html element to add each of the items
 --Use a loop to create an li each time someone wants to add a certain item.

STEP 2

1. Add a “Total” at the top of the page
- Create a h3 div? that will contain all the added prices.

2. Every time a user clicks on the “Buy” button, the total should be incremented
- loop through each item and add each price +=
